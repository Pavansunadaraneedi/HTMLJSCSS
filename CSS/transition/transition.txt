Transition: It is used to observe the change happened from one state to another state
You need to metioned transition in the intial state.
Transition: properties duration timing-function 
properties are used to mentioned which property change need to observered or can say 'all' to observe all change 
duration is used to mention the time it btakes to change from one state to another(in s or ms).

Timing function: It represents the speed it follows through the change.There are so many timing functiom like 
a.ease-in: it starts slowly and become faster 
b.ease-out: it start faster and become slowly
c.ease-in-out:it start slow,later fast and ends slowly
d.ease: its gradually increases the speed 
e.linear: maintain constant speed

Animations: Animations are nothing but a=multiple transition where it starts without any user intervention
every Animations contains keyframes

eg:
.element{
    animations-name: slideDown 2s ease;
}
    @keyframes slideDown{
        0%{
            tranform:translateX(0px)
        }
        100%{
            tranform:translateY(500px)
        }
    }
