Box Model is considered as the "heart of CSS".Every element that is discussed/given in web page is considered as a Box.
A Box contains
i.border
ii.padding
iii.margin
Inside the box content will be there 



i.border: border is used to draw thge outline of a Box
   border: size solid/dotted/dashed/double/groovy color;
   we can also apply border-left, border-right, border-top, border-bottom separatly
   border-radius: it is ther corner radius of an element and 50%
   border-radius can make perfect circle for a squared box 
   
ii.padding: padding-right , padding-left, padding-top&bottom can also be applied individually
increase of padding will increase height and width of the box. to avoid this and make box size same, we can use box-sizzing:border-box;

iii.margin: margin is used to make the gap outside the box it also works
