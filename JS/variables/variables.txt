iii. const 

i. var:

--> var values can be redeclared.
--> var value can be reassigned.
--> var valus can be used before intialization.

ii. let:
--> let is block scoped variable.
--> let value cannot be redeclared.
--> let value can be reassigned.
--> let value cannot be used  before intialization.

iii. const:

NOte: It is always better to use let & const.
