Loops: loops are used to iterative certain statements. Basically loops are two 



i.Entry Control loops: 
     These loops checks the condition at the starting of loop. it will enter only if the condition is true and exit when conditon is false. Until the condition is false the loop iterates.
     eg: while, for 
     check condition
     true
        runs statement1
        again check condition
    false
       stop

ii. Exit Control loops: 
     These loops checks the condition at the ending of loop. it will enter loop without condition but while exiting it chechks the condition, if it is true it re-run again, else it will stop
     eg: do while

     i.While: while is entry control loop that iterates until the condition fails.
     syntax: intialization;
             while(condition){
                //statement;
                updation;
             }
            
    eg : let i = 1;
        while(i<10){
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }

        Mostly when intialization, condition and udation are need to be in separate places, then will go for while 

        ii. do while : do while is a exit control loop which will get intial run without check and will iterate until condition false.
         intialization;
         do{
            //statement;
            updation;
         }while(condition);

         Task : print even number from 10 to  1 in reverse order using while and do while 
         output : 10 
                  8
                  6
                  4
                  2

        task2 : print all letter of the string in reverse order without space
        sample input: "I Love JS"
        sample output: "SJevoLI"

iii. for loop : for loop is used as a entry control loop but intialization,condition, updation are in same line
  
   for(intialization;condition;updation)
   {
      //statement
   }

//print number from 10 to 1 using for 

for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i--)
{
  console.log(i)
}

Variations of for:
  In JS, For loop have so many Variations such as for ..of , for..in and foreach, for..of; it is used to print all values from the array

  syntax: for(let variable of array)
  {
   console.log(variable)
  }
  here variable is considered as element 

  for..in: It is used to print all values of object using key values 
  syntax: for(let variable in array/object)
  {
   console.log(variable)
  }
  here variable is considered as index or object key
