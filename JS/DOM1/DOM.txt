HTML code (presentation code) is stored inside document object by browser, using this object, we can take values ,elements or any data from HTML to Javascript
To understand DOM(Document Object Manipulation), we need to understand these three stages 
i.selection 
ii. manipulation 
iii. creation

i. slection : Document object provides some basic functions to select elements from HTML
  a. getElementsByTagName('tagName') : It select all the elements using that the tagname and returns an array of elements.
  b.getElementsByTagName('className') : it selects all the elements using class name and returns an array of elements.
  c.getElementsById(idName) : It selects all elements using id and returns that elements
  d.queryselector: It selects firts element that mathes the query(css seletor)
  e. querySelectorAll: It is selects all element that matches the query and return array 

ii.Manipulation : we can manipulation element which are selectedd uninf its properties
  i. textContent : it contains all the text inside the element
  ii. style : using style attributes, you can add my style to the selected element
  iii. classList : using classList attributes ,you can add one or more classes , you can remove the classes, even toggle the classes
  iv. innerHTML: using innerHTML you can alter html code but it also have security issues like cross site scripting
  v. value : value is used to accepthtml input value.

iii. creation: we can create HTML element and add them into HTML using DOM creation we can achieve this using document.create
