Operators are used to perform simple operation between operands.
There are different types of operators:
i. Arithematic operators:

+ -- used for addition
- -- used for subtraction 
* -- used for multiplication
/ -- used for division 
% -- used for remainder
** -- used for power

ii.logical operators: 
    && -- return true only if all condition are true else false -- logical and
    || -- Return flase only if all condition are flase else true -- logical or
    ! -- return ttrue if condition is false vice versa -- loggical not

iii. RElational operators: 
    > -- used for comparing first value is greater than the second value or NOT
    < -- used for comparing first value is less than the second value or NOT
    >= -- used for comparing first value is greater than or equal to the second value or NOT
    <= -- used for comparing first value is less than or equal to  the second value or NOT
    == -- used to comparing two values equal or not irrespective of their data types
    === --  used to comparing two values and their data types are equal or NOT
    != -- used for comparing two value are not equal or noit irrespective of their data types
    !== -- used to comparing two values and their data types not equal or not 

iv.Assigment operators:
    += ---> a+=1 --> a=a+1;
    -= ---> a-=1 --> a=a-1;
    *= ---> a*=1 --> a=a*1;
    /= ---> a/=1 --> a=a/1;
    %= ---> a%=1 --> a=a%1;
    **= ---> a**=1 --> a=a**1;

v. Ternary operator:


eg: let c =4;
let x = (c>2) ? 10 : 20;
here x is 10 since c>2 is true

vi. Unary +: it bis used to change data type of any value to number . any value preceeding with unary + automatically converted asn number data type
eg: +'4'+2 ==>6

   JS  is a dynamically tyoed language. The datatype is decided based on value it contains . we can conver any data type using classes Number(), string(), boolean() etc ..,
   By default based on operation they also get converts 

vii. Increment(++) and decrement (--):
   These are used to increase or decrease the value by 1
   These operators have two variation pre and post 
    pre Increament (++a): it firts update (increase by 1) the value and assigns it 
    post Increament (a++): it first assign the value and then updates(increase by 1)
    post decrement(--a): it first upadtes (decreases by 2) the value and assign it 
    post decrement(a--): it first assign the value and then updated (decrease by 1)

    let x = 10 , y = 20;
    let z = ++x + x++ + --y + y--;
