Arrays: Arrays are used to store different elements. Arrays elements are represented in square brackets. Every Element contains unique position value called index. Arrays indexes starts with zero
eg: let arr = [8,9,6,-1,4,0];
console.log(arr[1]) //9
console.log(arr[10]) //undefined

//Arrays Methods
To perform different Tasks, Arrays have default methods 
i. length : length is used to get total number of elements in the array
ii. push : push is used to add a value/values to the end of the array
iii. pop : pop is used to remove the last value of the array
iv. unshift : unshift is used to add the values to the starting of the array
v. shift : shift is used to remove the starting value of the array.
vi. splice(index,deleteCount,insertValues):
     if only index number is given , deletes all values from that index
     if index and deleteCount is given, deletes as deleteCount values from index
     if index, deleteCount and insertValues are given, it removes values as per deleteCount from index and add insertValues from that index
vii. reverse: it is used to reverse the array elements
viii. indexOf : it is used to find the index of first occurence of a element
ix. lastIndexOf : it is used to find the index of last occurence of a element.
x.  forEach : forEach method takes a callback function to returns that callback function to each and every element of the array. it passes element and index to the call back function.
    array.forEach(callbackfunction(element,index))

    eg: let arr = [1,2,3];
        arr.forEach((v,i)=>{
            console.log(v,i)
        })

xi map: map is exactly same as forEach but map can return the valuesarray.map(callbackfunction(element,index))
       array.map (callbackfunction(element,index))
       eg : arr =[1, 2, 3, 4]
            const arr5 = arr.map((v)=>
            {
               return v*2
            })
            console.log(arr5)

xii.filter: filter is also exactly like map but it return only the condition values
            array.filter(callbackfunction(element,index))
            eg: let arr = [1,2,3]
            arr.filter((v,i)=>{
                console.log(v,i)
            })

xiii. some : some will return true if the condition is true for atleast one element of the array, else it return false
xiv. every : every will return true if the condition is true for every element of the array , else it returns false
xv. sort : sort is used to sort the elements of the array
    without callback function , sort will sort the elements based on alphabetically.It even checks the number one after other digits and compare them
    callback funt can take two parameters as neighbour values and 
    i.if function returns negitive, no need of swapping 
    ii.if the function return positive , swap the digits
    let arr =[5,4,6,1,11,14,,8]
    //console.log(arr.sort()) //[1,11,14,4,5,6,8]
arr.sort((a,b)=>a-b)//increasing order
console.log((a,b)=> b - a);//reverse order
console.log(arr);

xvi. reduce : reduce is used to get cummulative results from an array
