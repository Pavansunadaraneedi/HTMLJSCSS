localStorages and sessionStorage are two types of web storage mechanisms .Both allows you to store data locally on client slide

difference Between them:

localStorages data is peristence, it will stay even after Browser is closed or system restarts.
 sessionStorage data is temporary storage. when user closes the Browser or session expires automatically it will be deleted
data in session storage follows same orgin policy, means data is available for only for that domain.
 typically 5mb per origin.same goes for localStorage allows 

localStorage.setItem('name','Pavan')
localStorage.GetItem('name')
localStorage.RemoveItem('name')
localStorage.clear()
localStorage.length

sessionStorage.setItem('name','Pavan')
sessionStorage.GetItem('name')
sessionStorage.RemoveItem('name')
sessionStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.length
